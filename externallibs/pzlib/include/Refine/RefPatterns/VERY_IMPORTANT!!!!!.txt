IMPORTANT!!!!!

1. Only the regular refinement patterns (nodes localized in the middle of edges or c.g. of faces/volume) might have name different than "noname". This is because the refPatterns implementation uses this names to identify this regular refpatterns!. But if you want to put a name in a non regular refpattern, go ahead (its good to avoid, but its not prohibit).

2. If you don't care about the Id of refpatterns, use -50. By this way, the implementation identify that a unused Id (unique, free Id) must be steed. If you use refPatternId different than -50, the implementation will use this given Id, so you could localize this refPattern for some reason. But be carefulâ€¦ your given Id could be in use for another refpattern! In this case, see Log files or use "crazy" Ids to avoid this situation, like 946394 or something else ;)

The refPattern file must follow this instructions:

 *********************************************************************************************************************
 *
 * The archive to be imported (of an Refinement Pattern) refers to an geoMesh that contains the father element and its sub-elements.
 * Its format data is the following one:
 *
 * begin of file ....................................
 *
 * //block 1
 * int(ref_MeshNNodes)	int(ref_meshNElements)
 * int(ref_Id)	string(ref_Name)
 *
 * //block 2 - [the line above repeat for each node]
 * double(mesh_NodeCoordinates)
 * 
 * //block 3 - [the line above repeat for each element]
 * int(el_Type)		int(el_NNodes)		int(el_topologySequence)
 * 
 * ................................................................. end of file
 *
 * Obs.:
 *
 * - The refName of refinement pattern must be "noname" if the refpattern is NOT regular (nodes in the middle of edges or c.g. of faces/volume)
 *
 * - The nodeCoordinates of block 2 MUST be in R3 dimension (x,y,z);
 *
 * - The sequence described for the nodeCoordinates will assumption that the first will be the node of Id=0, second node of Id=1 etc.
 *   This convention will be used to describe the topologySequence of elements;
 *
 * - The first element described on the block 3 will be considered as the father element of RefPatternMesh.
 *   The following ones will be its sons (sub-elements);
 *
 * - The values of elType, can be:  line(1), triangle(2), quadrilateral(3), tetrahedron(4), pyramid(5), prism(6), hexaedron(7).
 *
 * - The topologySequence is the nodes Ids whose sequence declaration will define the element topology
