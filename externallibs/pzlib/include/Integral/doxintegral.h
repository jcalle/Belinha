 \section integral Quadrature rules

 \subsection symm_quads Symmetric quadrature rules for triangles and tetrahedra (see [1])
 
 In this module, we present a quadrature rules used for computation of numeric integrations. This is essential because the main computational work
 is on weak formulation, generally integration form. There are many implementations for quadrature rules in the literature, some of them finding the zeros
 of the special polinomials (p.e. [2]) or resolving minimization of high-order multivariate polynomials (p.e. 2).
 
 We use just symmetric quadrature rules with quadrature points lying within the master element and the 
 weights always positives. The symmetry of the quadrature points will can to help reducing the computational cost for construction of the stiffness matrices
 by the symmetry of finite element basis functions. A quadrature rule is said to be symmetric if it is invariant under permutations of the barycentric coordinates.
 Given a simplex \f$E\f$ with \f$n\f$ vertices \f${ v_1, ..., v_n}\f$, the \f$n\f$ barycentric coordinates \f$ (\xi_1, ..., \xi_n) \f$ of a point \f$P=(x,y,z)\f$
 with respect to \f$E\f$ is determined by \f$P=\Sigma_{i=1}^n \xi_i v_i\f$ and \f$\Sigma_{i=1}^n \xi_i = 1 \f$.
 Then whether a quadrature point (in barycentric coordinates) associated with weight \f$w\f$ has its barycentric coordinates permuted, the resultant point is also a quadrature point
 of the same quadrature rule and associated with same weight \f$w\f$.
