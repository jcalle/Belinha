 \page pg_analysis The TPZAnalysis class and its attributes
 

In order to perform a finite element analysis using a given computational mesh, the following steps need to be performed
\li The equations need to renumbered to optimize the bandwidth
\li The storage format of the global matrix needs to be choosen
\li The system resolution procedure needs to be choosen (e.g. direct solver, iterative solver, preconditioner)
\li The postprocessing variables and output file format needs to be specified

These steps are coordinated by the TPZAnalysis class
