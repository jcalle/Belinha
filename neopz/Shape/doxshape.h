/**
 * @defgroup shape The shape functions classes
 * @brief The shape functions are implemented in static classes, i.e. classes whose methods are not associated with
 * a given object. \n
 * This should facilitate their reuse in existing finite element codes \n
 * In the future, all element features which are object independent will be transferred to these classes \n
 * There is no base class of the Shape classes in order to improve efficiency (no virtual call mechanisms)
